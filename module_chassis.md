# Synopsis
_A short introduction to the module's purpose_

The Chassis module is responsible for the various mounting solutions for the lidar, including, but not limited to, mounting on a nacelle, a meteorological tower, the ground, a floating platform, or a mobile structure. The module must contain accelerometers and other sensors that can be interfaced with the Control module in order to adjust for measurement errors due to the movement of the lidar system. In addition to this, it should contain stabilizers and mechanisms for easy and secure installation, and should be operate in a wide range of atmospheric conditions.

# Safety
_This section describes the safety concerns of the module, and suggestions for mitigating any possible risks_

There are two major safety concerns for this module. First, the motors driving the rotation platform should be enclosed so as to prevent injury while the lidar is operating. These motors should not be powerful enough to harm individuals should they become caught in moving parts. Second, heavy lifting attachments must be labeled to indicate weight limits and correct operating procedures.
